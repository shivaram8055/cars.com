                <p>Lightning McQueen is a hotshot, rookie race car,
                    poised to become the youngest car ever to win the
                    Piston Cup Championship. He has just two things on his mind: 
                    winning and the perks that come with it. But when he 
                    in-advertently gets lost in the town of Radiator Springs,
                    he meets a new group of friends who challenge him to reconsider 
                    the car he wants to be.

                    the quickest towrope in Carburetor County and is always the 
                    first to lend a helping hand. He's the sweetest, most loyal 
                    guy in town and the first to befriend newcomer Lightning McQueen.
